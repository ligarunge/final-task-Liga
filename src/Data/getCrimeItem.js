            descriptionCrime: "Rich in the atmosphere of rural Australia, this gothic thriller sizzles with suspense and psychological intrigue as horrific family secrets come to light. Set in rural Australia in the 1940s, 1960s and 1980s (the plot smartly slips between the decades), Lyn Yeowart's The Silent Listener - her debut novel - is a dark and stormy psychological thriller focussed on family secrets and the search to fathom terrible truths. When Joy Henderson returns to her family's farm to care for George, her dying dad, she's confronted with a succession of horrendous events - both those that occur in her present, and traumatic experiences from her past. The very day after her father confesses to a horrific crime, heâ€™s found dead with his own belt around his neck.",

            descriptionCrime: "This powerful, eloquent thriller takes you into the painful world of two fathers who regret past choices while seeking vengeance for the murder of their sons. Hitting with hammer hard precision, thrilling storytelling is balanced with pointed social commentary in this fabulous novel set in the USA. Two fathers, both ex-cons, seek revenge for the murder of their sons. One of my favourite books from last year was S. A. Cosby's debut Blacktop Wasteland which I read for the Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger Award judging, it spoke to us all and was a highly commended shortlisted title.",

            descriptionCrime: "This darkly provocative and original novel plunges the reader into addiction, obsession, and murder. With sharp stinging humour and a bleakly dark plot this is a book to propel thoughts into a confrontational abyss. When Maeve considers changing her relationship with alcohol along with her need to murder men, and can't find the help she requires, she begins a support group for psychopaths. Every time you think Will Carver has pushed reading boundaries as far as he can go, along comes the next book. I have read a lot of thrillers and crime books over the years and I don't think anything has made me flinch as much as this one.",

            descriptionCrime: "Agatha Christie's debut novel was the first to feature Hercule Poirot, her famously eccentric Belgian detective.

All of them have secrets they are desperate to keep, but none can outwit Poirot as he navigates the ingenious red herrings and plot twists that earned Agatha Christie her well-deserved reputation as the queen of mystery.",
