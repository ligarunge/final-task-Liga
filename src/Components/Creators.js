                        <p>Like many children, Bruno loves books. But Bruno doesn't like to read books, he likes to eat them.
                            Big books, picture books, reference books . . . if it has pages, Bruno chews them up and swallows (but red ones are his favorite).
                            And the more he eats, the smarter he gets - he's on his way to being the smartest boy in the world! But one day he feels sick to his stomach.
                            And the information is so jumbled up inside, he can't digest it! Can Bruno find a way to enjoy books without using his teeth?

                            "But, Emi," said the teacher impatiently, "why in the world aren't you drawing on your paper?"
                            "I filled that long ago. There isn't room enough for my whole horse on that little snip of paper." Emilia replied.</p>
